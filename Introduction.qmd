## Introduction

Robust and reliable science is a key topic in today’s job market and will become even more important for future students and professionals. It’s about conducting research that is thorough and trustworthy, with a focus on methodological quality and reproducibility. This text explores what the concept entails, different approaches to it, and the consequences of unreliable research. A concrete example will highlight how using RStudio can make data analysis more efficient and transparent compared to Excel, particularly when working with regression tables. The text concludes with a discussion of relevant research and a reflection on the importance of scientific reliability in education and practice.

## Literature review

Smart stuff from others about the topic.

Use a least 20 citations, a least 5 of them must be new (not from the provided .bib file).

Use both in-line and normal citations.

Example:

@gentleman2005 argues that bla bla bla. On the other hand it's claimed that bla bla [@barbalorenaa.2018; @bartlett2008].

## Discussion of the reseach question

-   Should replicability be the norm or is this to much to ask for now?
-   Can Quarto documents help with reproducibility?
-   What problems remains and how can these be solved?
